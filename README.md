# haskell-blog-generator
 haskell blog generator project for https://lhbg-book.link/

Run `hello.hs` and copy output to `hello.html` and then open it in firefox.
I like to use vscode's liveserver extension and just open hello.html, which will listen for when changes are saved and update the webpage

```
runghc hello.hs > hello.html
firefox hello.html
```
